<div class="card purple">
  <h2>Daniel Clifford</h2>
  <p>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</p>
</div>

<div class="card grey">
  <h2>Jonathan Van Wert</h2>
  <p>I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding skills. I now work as a mobile developer for a big company. This was one of the best investments I’ve made in myself.</p>
</div>

<div class="card white">
  <h2>Kim Whittle</h2>
  <p>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
</div>
